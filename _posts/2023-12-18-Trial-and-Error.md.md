Title: Embracing the Learning Journey: From Python/Flask to Ruby/Jekyll on GitHub Pages

---

## Introduction

Embarking on a journey of self-hosting my website on GitHub Pages has been an exhilarating experience filled with trial and error. As a passionate learner, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and transition from Python and Flask to Ruby and Jekyll. This blog post chronicles my adventures, challenges, and triumphs as I navigate the exciting world of web development.

## The Decision to Self-Host on GitHub Pages

The idea of having control over my website's hosting and customization was enticing. GitHub Pages, with its simplicity and integration with version control, became the obvious choice. Little did I know that this decision would lead me to explore new programming languages and frameworks.

## Learning Python and Flask

Having a background in Python and Flask, I initially set out to create a dynamic and responsive website using these technologies. While Python was familiar territory, Flask introduced me to the world of web development, helping me understand the basics of routing, templates, and more.

However, the allure of trying something new and expanding my skill set prompted me to venture beyond the Python ecosystem.

## Enter Ruby and Jekyll

Ruby on Rails had caught my attention, but for a static website, Jekyll seemed like the perfect fit. Jekyll, a simple and blog-aware static site generator, aligns seamlessly with GitHub Pages. This shift in technology introduced me to Liquid, the templating language used by Jekyll, and the Ruby programming language.

Adapting to the Ruby syntax and Jekyll's structure was initially challenging, but it opened up new possibilities for creating a lightweight and efficient website. The liquid templating language, though different from what I was accustomed to, proved to be a powerful tool for building dynamic and content-rich pages.

## Trial and Error: The Learning Process

The transition wasn't without its hurdles. Converting my existing Python/Flask code to Ruby/Jekyll required patience and perseverance. I encountered syntax errors, spent hours debugging, and faced moments of frustration. However, each challenge became an opportunity to learn and grow.

As I delved into the Jekyll documentation, participated in online forums, and experimented with different configurations, I gained a deeper understanding of how static site generators operate. The trial-and-error process became an integral part of my learning journey, shaping my problem-solving skills and enhancing my adaptability.

## Celebrating Small Wins

Amidst the challenges, there were moments of triumph. Successfully configuring custom layouts, implementing dynamic content using Liquid, and deploying my site on GitHub Pages were significant milestones. These victories fueled my motivation to continue learning and exploring the vast landscape of web development.

## Conclusion

My journey from Python/Flask to Ruby/Jekyll on GitHub Pages has been a rollercoaster of learning, experimentation, and growth. Embracing the trial-and-error approach has not only refined my technical skills but also instilled in me a sense of resilience and curiosity.

As I continue to refine and expand my self-hosted website, I look forward to sharing more insights, challenges, and victories on this evolving learning path. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a fellow learner, I hope my experiences inspire you to embrace new technologies and relish the joy of continuous learning in the ever-evolving realm of web development.
