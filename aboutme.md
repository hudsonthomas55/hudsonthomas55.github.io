Greetings! I'm Thomas, a self-taught developer, ethical hacker, and cloud engineer based in the greater Lexington, KY area. With a passion for coding and securing digital landscapes, I have experience in programming languages like Python, Ruby, Bash, C, Powershell, and Perl.

Beyond the lines of code, I find joy in the art of brewing beer, the tranquility of hiking trails, and the thrill of kayaking adventures. Nature fuels my creativity and provides the perfect counterbalance to my digital pursuits.

As a proud Ravenclaw, my love for learning and curiosity knows no bounds. Hogwarts houses cultivate unique strengths, and I strive to continually expand my skill set, contributing positively to the tech community.

When I'm not in front of a screen, you'll likely find me lost in a good book or engaging in academic discussions on a variety of topics with fellow enthusiasts. The exploration of diverse subjects complements my passion for technology, providing a holistic perspective to both my professional and personal journey.

Join me on this multifaceted adventure where experiences shape expertise, and the wonders of the tech universe come together with the magic of storytelling.

Cheers to coding, creativity, and the magic that binds it all together!
